# Linear-Regression-Model(Car Dekho)

CarDekho.com is India's leading car search venture that helps users buy cars that are right for them. In this project, the dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. Its website and app carry rich automotive content such as expert reviews, detailed specs and prices, comparisons as well as videos and pictures of all car brands and models available in India. The company has tie-ups with many auto manufacturers, more than 4000 car dealers and numerous financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of vehicles.

In this project, the dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

# Objective:
In this project I'm trying to analyse and visualize the used car prices from the dataset in order to predict the most probable car prices with the use of basic linear regression model.


The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

name  -  It shows the name of the car which includes brand and model of the car.

year  -  It shows the year in which car was bought.

selling_price  -  It shows selling price of the car.
